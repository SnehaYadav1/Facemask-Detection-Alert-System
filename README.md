# Face-Mask Detector

Real time face-mask detection using Deep Learning and OpenCV

# About Project

This project uses Deep Neural Network, more specifically a Convolution Neural Network to differentiate between images of people with and without masks. The CNN manages to get a training accuracy of **99.93%**.

Covid-19 pandemic has impacted entire humanity today in one or
the other way and wearing a Face mask is a new norm nowadays
while going in public places to restrict the spread of corona
virus.This application is a kind of alert system which detects the
